# Hate-Speech-Detection
Hate speech detection from code-mixed Hindi-English tweets using deep learning models. This project reports an increment to the state-of-the-art in hate speech detection for English-Hindi code-mixed tweets. The models result in an improvement of about 12% in F-score over a past work that used statistical classifiers. Details of the project will be soon explaied here.
